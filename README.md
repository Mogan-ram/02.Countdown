# Countdown Timer Project

## Overview
This project is a countdown timer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a specific date and time in the future and counts down to that moment, displaying the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Contains the basic HTML structure for the countdown timer, including input fields for the target date and time, a "Start" button, and an area to display the remaining time.
  
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles that enhance the visual appeal of the countdown timer, customizing fonts, colors, and layout.
  
- **script.js**: Implements the JavaScript functionality for the countdown timer, handling user input, calculating remaining time, updating the display in real-time, and notifying the user when the countdown reaches zero.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the target date and time in the provided input fields.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate the countdown.
4. The remaining time will be displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. When the countdown reaches zero, a message will be displayed to inform you.

## Optional Features
- Users can set multiple countdowns on the same page.
- Sound or visual effects can be added when the timer reaches zero.
- CSS animations can be used to further customize the appearance of the timer.
